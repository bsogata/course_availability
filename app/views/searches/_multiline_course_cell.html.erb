<!--
  Breaks text into two lines.
  
  This is used for table entries that take two rows, such as the room of courses with labs,
  where the lecture room is on one row and the lab room is on the next.  Actually creating two rows
  would create an additional border though (as shown in the course list page), which is not
  aesthetically pleasing and makes it more difficult to visually group the lecture and lab
  together.  For that reason, this adds a line break to replace the newline, keeping the field in
  one table row but on separate lines.
